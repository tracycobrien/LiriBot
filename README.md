# LiriBot

### Overview

In this assignment, I will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

### Deployment

1. I will make a new GitHub Repo and Clone it to my computer

2. I will run npm install

3. I will retrieve the data that will power this app, using the `axios` packages: the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs.
