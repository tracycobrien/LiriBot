# LiriBot

### Overview

In this assignment, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

### Deployment

1. I made a new GitHub Repo and Cloned it to my computer

2. I ran npm install

3. I retrieved the data that powered this app, using the `axios` packages: the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs.
